          <h2> ABOUT US</h2>
          <br><br>
          <p> Our vision at Mzamomtsha Primary School is to empower students to acquire,
             demonstrate, articulate and value knowledge and skills that will support them, as life-long learners,
             to participate in and contribute to the global world and practice the core values of the school: respect, tolerance & inclusion, and excellence.
             Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs.
            We stress the total development of each child: spiritual, moral, intellectual, social, emotional, and physical.  <br>
